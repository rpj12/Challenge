# Challenge - Machine Learning
In this first two-member Machine Learning project, I was Machine Learning engineer. We worked on comparing pairs of images using scikit-learn. <br>

We tested different algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks and Boosting. <br>

We fine-tuned the parameters to have the best accuracy possible. We sought a tradeoff between the computation time (several days for kNN when running on the whole dataset!) and the accuracy. 
<br> 

Our final accuracy was approx. 0.99787. The maximum accuracy possible was 0.99789.
